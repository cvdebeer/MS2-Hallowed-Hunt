### Project Goals

The main goal of this game is to provide a fun and challenging memory game for young and old alike to enjoy.  
It is designed to test the user’s memory and ability to match up pairs as quickly and efficiently as possible. The replay value is endless as the cards will reshuffle into a new arrangement at the end of every game.

This website has been designed mainly with the desktop user in mind, although the easy level should be playable on a tablet.The amount of cards in the ‘Medium’ and ‘Hard’ level may not carry well onto devices smaller than a tablet.

### Player goals

The target audience is users over the age of seven with different difficulty levels available to experience.

Players goals are:

- A fun game to play.
- The ability to choose their difficulty level, thereby, hopefully, engaging even the sharpest mind.
- Easy to understand the rules of the game.
- Easy to navigate the game board.
- Fun and engaging images that change at every level.
  
### Developer Goals

- To develop a game that all players across a wide range of ages will enjoy and stay engaged in for a happy amount of time.
- To learn how to use Javascript to make user interaction with an application more dynamic.
- To better understand the way that HTML, CSS and Javascript work together to achieve envisioned results.

### User Stories

As a player I would want:

1. To enjoy the visual aspects of the game and the theme applied.
2. To easily find out how to play the game.
3. To keep track of my score and time playing the game.
4. A mute button in order to switch the sound on an off easily.
5. To be able to select my level of difficulty at any stage of game play.

### Design Choices

I chose the Halloween theme and motive  firstly,  due to the of the time of year that I am building the game and secondly, my children are obsessed with Halloween and how better to engage my seven year old’s mind that wrapping a memory exercise in a game.

#### Fonts

The fonts selected initially for the game were **Creepster, Griffy** and **Henny Penny** as they are popular Halloween fonts.

#### Colours

As orange and black are popular colours around Halloween I stayed with these as my primary colours.

Other colours used were selected as compatible with the help of colormind.io. and were grey white and a bit of tan/gold.

#### Styling

The cards and buttons were all styled with rounded corners as that is what you would expect from a deck of cards and it complements the Creepster font which has no sharp edges.

#### Images

Images for the cards and backgrounds were all in keeping with the Halloween theme.

Each level introduces new backgrounds and face cards, aimed at increasing visual pleasure around each level and helping the user to identify with the level they are on.

#### Audio files

To provide the feeling of sitting at a table with an actual deck of cards, a card flipping audio file has been used. This can be easily switched on and off by the user.

#### Wireframes

My wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) during the Scope plane as part of my design and planning process.
